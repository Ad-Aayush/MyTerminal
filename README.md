To compile the code simply type make in the shell and press enter. An executable "myShell" will be created.
For help related to my implementations of the commands, use the "help" command. While testing the code, please do not
copy any file which has the name of a folder(files with extensions cause no issues), as it may accedentally change the permissions of the folder. All commands implemented by me start with "my" and shall not be run without it, as the program will use a system call otherwise as I am running the same code for both the questions.
